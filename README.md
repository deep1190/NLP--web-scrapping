# Projects based on NLP

This repository contains multiple hands-on projects based on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The projects are implemented in **Python** using popular NLP libraries and frameworks, and are suitable for beginners as well as intermediate learners.  

Each project demonstrates a specific NLP technique, from basic text preprocessing to fine-tuning pre-trained language models for text classification.

## Projects Included

1. **Fine-tune a Pre-Trained LLM for Text Classification**
   - Fine-tuning a pre-trained **Large Language Model (LLM)** on a custom dataset for text classification tasks.
   - Demonstrates how to adapt models like **BERT, GPT, or other transformer-based models** to your specific classification needs.
   - **Tech Used:** HuggingFace Transformers, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.

2. **NLP-Pipeline**
   - A complete pipeline for NLP tasks including **tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, and feature extraction**.
   - **Tech Used:** NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Classifying text (like reviews or tweets) as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - **Tech Used:** NLTK, TextBlob, Scikit-learn, Pandas.
